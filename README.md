# CorrAndCov
Correlation and Variance

Based on code originally written by Kabir & Darius to calculate time-crosscorre>

### What the code does
1.Coarse-grains the images (resize - scalefactor < 1)
2.Calculates time Autocorrelation function for each box in Act channel using di>
3.and Crosscorrelation between Act and the Binder chnls and saves the data as *>
4.Calculates 2d Coefficient-of-variation (CoV) Maps of Act, B1 and B2
5.Generates resized correlation maps (+ and -): AcAc, AcB1, AcB2, B1B2
6.Plots CoV of Actin vs CC of Act-B1 Act-B2 and B1-B2 (at different time lags)
